Before directly starting building pipelines you need to connect your jenkins-master to jenkins-slave 
(also called are maven-slave/maven-server/mavne). 

Here are the steps for that: 

# Jenkins Master and Slave Setup
1. Add credentials 
2. Add node

##### Add Credentials #####
1. Manage Jenkins --> Manage Credentials --> System --> Global credentials --> Add credentials 
2. Provide the below info to add credentials
    kind: `ssh username with private key`
    Scope: `Global`
    ID: `maven_slave`
    Username: `ubuntu`
    private key: `project_gtak.pem key content`

##### Add node #####
Follow the below setups to add a new slave node to the jenkins
1. Goto Manage Jenkins --> Manage nodes and clouds --> New node --> Permanent Agent
2. Provide the below info to add the node
    Number of executors: `3`
    Remote root directory: `/home/ubuntu/jenkins` Labels: `maven`
    Usage: `Use this node as much as possible` Launch method: `Launch agents via SSH`
    Host: `<Private_IP_of_Slave>`
    Credentials: `<Jenkins_Slave_Credentials>`
    Host Key Verification Strategy: `Non verifying Verification Strategy`
    Availability: `Keep this agent online as much as possible`

-> After this you need to check the logs of the node and it will show you 
        Agent successfully connected and online.
